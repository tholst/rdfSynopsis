{"name":"Rdfsynopsis","tagline":"A framework and command-line tool for statistical analyses of RDF datasets.","body":"The software RDFSynopsis was written in Java. It uses the Apache Jena framework\r\n[6] to process RDF data and to query SPARQL endpoints. The goal for the design\r\nof RDFSynopsis was to write code that could be used both, as a stand-alone tool\r\noperated from the command-line, and as a framework of classes for reuse in other\r\nsoftware. \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThe figure below presents the class hierarchy and package arrangement.\r\nThree concepts are at the center of RDFSynopsisâ€™s design: Datasets, Statistical\r\nCriteria, and Analyzers. The basic idea behind these concepts is to define a dataset\r\nanalysis in three steps.\r\n\r\n1. Define the dataset that shall be analyzed.\r\n1. Define the statistical criteria according to which the dataset shall be analyzed.\r\n1. Provide the dataset and the criteria to an analyzer, and let it do the work.\r\n\r\n![Architecture of rdfSynopsis](http://tholst.github.io/rdfSynopsis/classDiagram1.jpg)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
